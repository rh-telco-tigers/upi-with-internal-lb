Please refer to the types defined in the version/commit used by OpenShift of the upstream kubernetes. It's important to note that, since the fields of the kubelet configuration are directly fetched from upstream the validation of those values is handled directly by the kubelet. Please refer to the upstream version of the relevant kubernetes for the valid values of these fields. Invalid values of the kubelet configuration fields may render cluster nodes unusable.
